  - '"Now that we''ve arrived at the next level, and since you''ve already learned
    about items used on the spot in the previous level, this time I''ll introduce
    you to items that can be used on rocks.'
  - When used on a rock, these items can either remove the rock or reveal if there's
    a treasure beneath it.
  - This time, click the <b>[mouse wheel]</b> on a rock to open the item window!

  line2:
  - Items that are used on rocks can only be used when there are rocks adjacent to
    them.
  - 'The item on the right is <b>[Holy Water]</b>. When <b>[used on a rock]</b>,
    it tells you whether the <b>[rock is hiding a treasure or not]</b>.

    

    However,
    if it''s not hiding a treasure, it can''t distinguish whether it''s a trap or
    just a regular rock.'
  - 'The item to the south is a <b>[Pickaxe]</b>. Unlike other items, it can be used
    infinitely.

    When <b>[used on a rock]</b>, it breaks the rock, and if there
    was <b>[a trap, it eliminates the trap]</b>.

    

    However, if you <b>[break
    a rock hiding a treasure]</b>, it''s an immediate <b>[game over]</b>, so use
    it only when you''re sure it''s not a treasure!'
  - 'If you''re confused, open the <b>[menu window]</b> to read the item descriptions
    again!

    

    Now, let''s use the items to find all the treasures while
    avoiding traps!'

  - 'If the items in the previous level could heal you or change the numbers,

    

    the
    items for rocks can either break them or confirm if there''s a treasure underneath.'
  - Now, let's move down to the next level!
